# Tree Iterators GUI - Systems Programming, Exercise 4

Welcome to the Tree Iterators GUI project for Systems Programming, Exercise 4. This project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of tree data structures, their traversal methods, and visualization through a graphical user interface (GUI). It's an educational tool aimed at helping students and developers alike to grasp the concepts of tree algorithms and their applications in a more interactive and engaging way.

## Key Features

- **Generic Tree Container**: A flexible implementation that allows for the creation and manipulation of tree structures with a specified maximum degree and data type.
- **Multiple Traversal Methods**: Supports a variety of traversal algorithms including BFS, DFS, Pre-Order, In-Order, Post-Order, and Heap traversals, offering a deep dive into tree exploration techniques.
- **Interactive GUI**: A user-friendly graphical interface that enables users to visually interact with the tree, making learning and understanding tree structures more intuitive.
- **Complex Number Support**: The project also includes a Complex number class, demonstrating the tree container's ability to handle various data types through basic arithmetic and comparison operations.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions in the subsequent sections to set up the project, build the tree structures, and start interacting with the GUI.

Thank you for exploring the Tree Iterators GUI project. We hope it serves as a valuable learning resource and enhances your understanding of tree data structures and algorithms.

To compile the project, run ``qmake Treegui.pro``

and then run the gui of the tree ``make tree``

and to run the tests ``make test``
